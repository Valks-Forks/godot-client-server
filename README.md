# Godot: Game + Server

My first attempt at programming a Client-Server socket, using the Godot's API for client-side stuff and standard C#'s UDP for Server side

My plan here is to create a template for any multiplayer game idea that I might have in the future. Building the server in standard C# in order to make the server more engine-agnostic.

**NOTE:** this is very much a test, so far the server doesn't work as expected
